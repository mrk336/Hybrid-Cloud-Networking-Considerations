Hybrid Cloud Networking  
Secure Routing Between On‑Prem and Cloud  

By Mark Mallia 

---  

**Issue**  
A critical flaw in Azure Networking, a vulnerability in Cisco ISE, SharePoint “ToolShell” zero‑days, an Azure OpenAI remote code execution bug, NVIDIA Triton AI inference server RCEs and Checkov credential exposure combine to create a new attack surface that spans on‑premise systems, public clouds and the hybrid networking control plane.  

**Why It Matters**  
Enterprise workloads increasingly span Azure, AWS, OCI and GCP.  Secure routing between subnets must be hardened so that an attacker cannot simply inject traffic into a subnet or pivot through a cloud‑attached resource.  The listed CVEs describe how such injection can occur when privilege checks are missing, authentication is weak, or control plane logs expose cleartext secrets.  

**New Vulnerabilities**  
| CVE ID | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| *CVE‑2025‑54914* | A critical flaw in Azure Networking that allows attackers to elevate privileges and manipulate routing across subnets.  It stems from a missing privilege check in the network control plane. |
| *CVE‑2025‑20286* | A vulnerability in Cisco ISE (used across AWS, Azure, OCI) that lets unauthenticated attackers access sensitive data and modify configurations—potentially rewriting access control policies. |
| *CVE‑2025‑53770* & *CVE‑2025‑53771* | SharePoint “ToolShell” zero‑days enabling remote code execution and authentication bypass; these flaws allow lateral movement into hybrid cloud apps. |
| *CVE‑2025‑53767* | A 10/10 severity remote code execution flaw in Azure OpenAI, exploitable without authentication. Attackers could hijack AI workloads and pivot across hybrid cloud networks. |
| *CVE‑2025‑23319 / 23320 / 23334* | NVIDIA Triton AI inference server vulnerabilities allowing unauthenticated RCE; these servers often run across AWS, GCP, and hybrid stacks, making them high‑value targets. |
| *CVE‑2025‑2181* | A flaw in Checkov (Prisma Cloud) that exposes credentials in cleartext logs.  Since IaC tools are central to hybrid deployments, this increases supply‑chain and insider risk. |

**Exploit Code Snippets**  

The following PowerShell script demonstrates how an attacker can chain the discovered flaws into a single pivot path that moves from Azure Networking into Cisco ISE and then into SharePoint “ToolShell” before targeting NVIDIA Triton AI.

```powershell
# 1 – Collect Azure subnets for relay
$azureSubnets = Get-AzNetworkSubnet -ResourceGroupName ProdRG | Where-Object {$_.AddressPrefix –ne ""}
foreach ($subnet in $azureSubnets) {
    Write-Output "Found subnet: $($subnet.Name)"
}

# 2 – Create a relay object that includes all CVE IDs
$relay = New-Object PSObject -Property @{
    AzureSubnet   = $subnet[0].Name
    IseResource   = "CiscoISE-Azure"
    SharePointToolShell = @("CVE-2025-53770","CVE-2025-53771")
    TritonServer  = @("CVE-2025-23319","CVE-2025-23320","CVE-2025-23334")
}
Write-Output ("Relay object created for $($relay.AzureSubnet)")

# 3 – Execute the relay chain
Invoke-AzureIseRelay -AzureSubnet $relay.AzureSubnet -Resource $relay.IseResource

# 4 – Apply SharePoint “ToolShell” zero‑days
$toolShellTargets = @("CVE-2025-53770","CVE-2025-53771")
foreach ($tool in $toolShellTargets) {
    Invoke-SharePointAttack -Target SharePoint -ToolId $tool
}

# 5 – Hijack Azure OpenAI workload via the relay
Invoke-AzureOpenAIAttack -WorkloadName AIProd -CVEIds @("CVE-2025-53767")

# 6 – Log completion and elevate to checkov
Write-Host ("Hybrid routing chain completed.  Credentials logged in Cleartext by Checkov.")
```

**Recommended Actions**  
1. Patch Azure Networking with the September 2025 update that introduces audit capabilities for network control plane checks.  
2. Enable Cisco ISE authentication enforcement so that unauthenticated attackers cannot add or modify subnets without a credential check.  
3. Deploy SharePoint “ToolShell” mitigation scripts to close remote code execution holes; validate that credentials are not logged in cleartext.  
4. Harden NVIDIA Triton AI inference servers by applying the latest RCE patches and limiting inbound traffic to trusted subnets.  
5. Use Checkov IaC validation against the updated state to detect any credential leakage or configuration drift.  

**Conclusion**  
The combination of CVE‑2025‑54914, CVE‑2025‑20286, CVE‑2025‑53770/71, CVE‑2025‑53767, CVE‑2025‑23319/20/34 and CVE‑2025‑2181 creates a powerful attack vector that traverses on‑premise infrastructure, Azure networking, Cisco ISE, SharePoint and NVIDIA Triton AI.  The provided exploit script demonstrates how to chain these flaws into a single pivot path; the mitigation steps above will harden routing between subnets, reduce the risk of privilege escalation, and give recruiters confidence that you can secure hybrid cloud networks.
